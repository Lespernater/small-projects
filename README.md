# Small Projects in Bioinformatics

Below are model-building demos that explore machine learning packages using case studies in bioinformatics.

## Classification Models in R

### RF-insecta-classifier:
[Random Forest Taxonomic Classification of CytB DNA sequences in Orders of Insecta](https://github.com/Lespernater/small-projects/blob/main/RF-insecta-classifier/RF-insecta-classifier.pdf)

Random forest taxonomic classifier for Insecta using 8-mer feature selection from cytochrome B sequences. Completed in Oct 2023 in R.

### sPLSDA-Explore:
[sPLS-DA and DIABLO using Multi-omics in Breast Tumour Subtyping](https://github.com/Lespernater/small-projects/blob/main/sPLSDA-Explore/sPLSDA.pdf)

Exploration and demonstration of Sparse Partial Least Squares - Discriminant Analysis (sPLSDA) in classification of breast cancer based on miRNA and multi-omics data. Completed in Nov 2022. Primarily R.
