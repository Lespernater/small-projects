# Small Projects in Bioinformatics

## Classification Models

Below are model-building demos that explore machine learning packages using case studies in bioinformatics. Links show PDFs to follow along.

### RF-insecta-classifier:
[Random Forest Taxonomic Classification of CytB DNA sequences in Orders of Insecta](https://github.com/Lespernater/small-projects/blob/main/RF-insecta-classifier/RF-insecta-classifier.pdf)

Random forest taxonomic classifier for Insecta using 8-mer feature selection from cytochrome B sequences. Completed in Oct 2023 in R.

### sPLSDA-Explore:
[sPLS-DA and DIABLO using Multi-omics in Breast Tumour Subtyping](https://github.com/Lespernater/small-projects/blob/main/sPLSDA-Explore/sPLSDA.pdf)

Exploration and demonstration of Sparse Partial Least Squares - Discriminant Analysis (sPLSDA) in classification of breast cancer based on miRNA and multi-omics data. Completed in Nov 2022. Primarily R.

## Sequence Assembly

### DeNovo-Viral-Assembly:
[Identification of Phage Genomes in the Gastrointestinal Tracts of Patients with Asthma](https://github.com/Lespernater/small-projects/blob/main/DeNovo-Viral-Assembly/De_Novo_Viral_Assembly_Report.pdf)

*De novo* assembly of viral phage genomes from metagenomic sequences from fecal samples of people with Asthma. Completed in April 2023 in Bash, Python and R.

## Bioinformatic Method Optimizations

### DE-of-miRNAs-with-PCA-Covariates
[Differential Expression of Serum microRNAs in Brain Metastasis of Breast Cancer](https://github.com/Lespernater/small-projects/blob/main/DE-of-miRNAs-with-PCA-Covariates/Differential%20Expression%20of%20Serum%20microRNAs%20in%20Brain%20Metastasis%20of%20Brest%20Cancer.pdf)

Incorporating covariate adjustments when using Na√Øve Bayes estimation of dispersion for negative binomial distributions of each miRNA count and the impact on downstream general linear model on the fitting for exact testing of differences in the means of these distributions. Completed in Dec 2023 in R.
